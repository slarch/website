                <ul>
                    <li>There is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.<br/><em>- Morpheus, fictional character</em></li>
                    <li>Only a Sith deals in absolutes.<br/><em>- Obi-wan Kenobi, fictional character</em></li>
                    <li>Science keeps down the weed of superstition not by logic, but by rendering the mental soil unfit for its cultivation.<br/><em>- John Tyndall, Irish physicist and educator</em></li>
                    <li>Live a good life.  If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by.  If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them.  If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.<br/><em>- Marcus Aurelius, Roman Stoic philosopher and emperor</em></li>
